### Large numbers


Historically there have been multiple ways of writing numbers larger than 4000. The number 5000 can be written as v̅ (with a bar on top), as IↃↃ, or even V M. In this version of Roman Numerals, large numbers will automatically appear with a bar over them, but can also can be written as IↃↃ if you choose to enable them in the settings.
