Do you need to spell out out numbers, transforming numbers into words? Are you learning another language or do you live in another country and you need to write them in another language?

<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://appstore.com/robclarke/numbery"><img class="aligncenter" title="Available on the iPhone App Store" alt="Available on the iPhone App Store" src="/assets/images/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_135x40.png" width="135" height="40"></a></p>

This app can convert 99 to ninety-nine, 1994 to mille-neuf-cent-quatre-vingt-quatorze and 322463 to dreihundertzweiundzwanzigtausendvierhundertdreiundsechzig and if you want to hear them spoken automatically by your iPhone, just tap on the speak button.

### Languages:

This first version is the _EFIGS_ version, so that means English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. However, you can choose between British English and American English (one hundred AND two or just one hundred two), and the French number system used in France, Belgium or Switzerland, with the option to turn off hyphens if you prefer "quatre cent" to "quatre-cent".

Portuguese is planned for the next version and other languages will be arriving together with extra features.

### Long words:

Languages such as Italian and German write numbers as a single word, so for those number systems you will see another line underneath with the spelling as a single word. If those numbers get too small you can just rotate your iPhone and the keyboard will disappear allowing you to focus on the numbers.
