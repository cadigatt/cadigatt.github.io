Do you need to write numbers in words? Perhaps you need to write them in another language? This app can help you transform 1994 to mille-neuf-cent-quatre-vingt-quatorze and 322463 to dreihundertzweiundzwanzigtausendvierhundertdreiundsechzig and if you want to hear them spoken automatically by your iPhone, just tap on the speak button.

This first version is the EFIGS version, so that means English, French, Italian, German, and Spanish. However, you can choose between British English and American English (one hundred AND two or just one hundred two), and the French number system used in France, Belgium or Switzerland, with the option to turn off hyphens if you prefer "quatre cent" to "quatre-cent".

Languages such as Italian and German write numbers as a single word, so for those number systems you will see another line underneath with the spelling as a single word. If those numbers get too small you can just rotate your iPhone and the keyboard will disappear allowing you to focus on the numbers.

### Languages:

- English (British English and American English)
- French (French, Belgium, and Swiss)
- Italian

- Spanish

Other languages will be arriving together with extra features, so please get in touch if you have any requests or comments.
