This is the support page for `Roman Dates : convert any date into roman numerals`.


### Why do the dates appear as 4 February or February 4?

The dates will either appear as Day-Month-Year or Month-Day-Year. This is determined automatically from your regional settings on the iPhone. If you have your phone set to US English then the dates will appear as Month-Day-Year.

### I have changed my regional settings but the dates still appear wrong!

When you change your regional settings, the date picker automatically changes, but the roman numerals doesn't change. Make sure that you change the numbers on the date picker so that the dates appear correctly.

### I want to convert Roman Numerals and not dates

If you want to convert Roman Numerals, then the [Roman Nums : Converter](/romansnums/) app is probably what you are looking for.
